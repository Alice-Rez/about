# Getting started with Github classroom

## general setup

requirement: You should be a member on [github.com/fbw2-lei](https://github.com/fbw2-lei/)

check: Make sure you accepted the invitation to the fbw2-lei organization.

indicator: opening your github profile (`github.com/username`), you should get a list of organizations listed below your picute and bio, regognize the icon also used on our slack workspace.

## participating in exercises / assignments

Future exercices will be shared as links to Github Classroom assignments (Zoom Meeting, Slack-Channel etc.)
e.g. (you already did this): [Assignment: Markdown Introduction](https://classroom.github.com/a/4x_tH1sJ)

follow the link to the assignment at GitHub Classroom

## first time stuff

the following steps should only appear the first time when joining a classroom / assignment

### authorize github account to connect with classroom

classroom requires you to connect your github account with the classroom platform.

### link classroom student and github account
In classroom a list of participants was created. First time you join a classroom you'll be asked who of those participants you are. This creates a link between the classroom student roster entry and your github account.

![link student and account](https://github.com/fbw2-lei/about/blob/master/images/02%20-%20join%20and%20assign%20to%20student%20name.jpg)

In case of a wrong choice only classroom admins can change the linkage. 

## accept the assignment

with an authorized account (connected github and github classroom) you can accept the assigment

![accept assignment](https://github.com/fbw2-lei/about/blob/master/images/03%20-%20accept%20assignment.jpg)

depending on how the assigment was created, the next steps are a little different:

### a new individual repository is created
![solution repo is created](https://github.com/fbw2-lei/about/blob/master/images/04%20-%20solution%20repo%20is%20created.jpg)

following the link will bring you back to a repository created inside of our GitHub organization.
If not template for the solution repository was set up, you face an empty repository.
It's also possible that the solution repository already contains files to start with.

### option 1: only work on github.com website in browser

you can decide to only work in the browser to create the solution.

![create and upload links](https://github.com/fbw2-lei/about/blob/master/images/06%20-%2001%20work%20on%20github.jpg)

_easy to miss_: the two links after Get Started with **creating a new file** and **upload and existing file** .

#### create new file

![create new file](https://github.com/fbw2-lei/about/blob/master/images/06%20-%2001a%20in%20browser%20-%20commit%20new%20file.jpg)

provide a filename, content and a commit comment before klicking `commit changes`

![upload files](https://github.com/fbw2-lei/about/blob/master/images/06%20-%2001b%20in%20browser%20-commit%20uploaded%20file.jpg)

you can either drag and drop files from the graphical file manager or click the **choose your files** link to get a system default _file open_-dialog.

provide a commit comment and klick `commit changes`
  
## done

for an individual assignment this is the minimal path to submit a solution, teachers can proof.
  
### you gain acccess to a group repository to solve a task together with others
- [ ] todo: extend manual to group assigments
