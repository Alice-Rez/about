## first time stuff

the following steps should only appear the first time when joining a classroom / assignment

### authorize github account to connect with classroom

classroom requires you to connect your github account with the classroom platform.

### link classroom student and github account
In classroom a list of participants was created. First time you join a classroom you'll be asked who of those participants you are. This creates a link between the classroom student roster entry and your github account.

In case of a wrong choice only classroom admins can change the linkage. 

## accept the assignment

with an authorized account (connected github and github classroom) you can accept the assigment

depending on how the assigment was created:

  1. a new individual repository is created
  2. you gain acccess to a group repository to solve a task together with others
