# This is a teaching environment of the Digital Career Insitute

Dear Students,

this repository should (for now) be the only one being displayed with this readme.md to explain the use of this organization.

All of you have been invited to join this organization as a member.

You can see:
  * all repositories that you created yourself, regardless of their public/private setting
  * repositories that were created by accepting an assignment at the github classroom (regularly marked private)
  * repositories others (like me) marked as public
  
please **don't** share the link to the organization with others, without being invited and logged in to github.com they would end up with a 404 file not found error anyway.
